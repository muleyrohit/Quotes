<p >Grant to us the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed,courage to change that which can be 
      changed,and wisdom to know the one from the other. <br>
      ~ Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr

<p >Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The misfits. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. 
They are not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them. Disagree with them. Glorify or vilify them. 
About the only thing you cant do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. For some may see them as the crazy ones, 
we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
