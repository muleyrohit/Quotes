  <p > When there's speech that is completely forbidden, and questions that are not allowed to be asked, normally,
  you should assume those things are simply true.<br>
 ~ <b>Aristotle.</b>
  </p>
  <br>
	
 <p >You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.<br>
~ <b>Jack London</b>

  </p>

 <p>The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.<br>
~ <b>William Arthur Ward</b>

<p>Some men write their lives to save themselves from ennui, careless of the amount they inflict on their readers.
    Others write their personal history, lest some kind friend should survive
    them, and, in showing off his own talent, unwittingly show them up.
    Others, again, write their own life from a different motiveâ€”from fear
    that the vampires of literature might make it their prey.
    I have no desire to write my own biography, as long as I have strength
    and means to do better work.<br>
~ <b>Charles Babbage, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (1864)</b>
