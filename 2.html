  <p >Provability is a weaker notion than the truth.<br>

  <p >To give your cow or sheep a large space in a meadow is to control it.<br>

 <p >Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?
     "Yes".
     Are you gonna build them?
     "No".
     Then what good was the yes?
     Loving you is work Jerry. Hard work.
     Like building a homeless shelter.
     Nobody wants to say no to doing it, but few people put the work in.
     So what do you say? Do you see me working here?
     Does this conversation seem tedious to me?
     "Sort   
     So stop asking and maybe I will love you more.<br>
  ~ Beth Smith, Rick and Morty (On being asked whether she loves him)
